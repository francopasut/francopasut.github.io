I have nothing to say except that I have other websites that you can visit.

Here's the list of sites: 

- [My Blogger Blog](https://francopasut-en.blogspot.com) (also in [Italian Language](https://francopasut.blogspot.com))
- [My Tumblr Blog](https://francopasut.tumblr.com/)
- [My Medium Profile](https://medium.com/@FrancoPasut)

This is a static website: no PHP, no Javascript, no databases, no banners, no tricks. 

All is written in static HTML language.

Therefore, no personal data, no cookies are collected in any way.

I don't know if notes written in this online notebook can be useful to anyone. They are primarily written for me, with the purpose to organize my ideas and to keep my mind in training, now that I'm getting old.

If you need to contact me you can write to my Gmail account with _franco dot pasut_

Thank you for visiting my online notebook.
