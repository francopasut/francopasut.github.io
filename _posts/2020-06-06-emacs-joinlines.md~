## Join-lines: Vim vs Emacs ##

_Vim_ has a very simple system to join two lines. all you have to do is press the `J` (uppercase) key inside the line above.

_Emacs_, on first approach, seems to be a bit more laborious, especially if you use a keyboard with US International Dead Keys layout in MS Windows or GNU/Linux.

However, with a few small adjustments, it can become super-efficient.

What follows is my solution but, of course, everyone can find other, even more efficient solutions.

## The original keys binding ##

The original keys binding is apparently very simple: `C-^`.

But in the _US International Dead Keys Layout_ you must press three keys to obtain the `^` character, _Shift + Alt Gr + 6_, as you can see in the following image (the correct character is the one at the top right in the middle square):

Try to look at the position of the hands needed to get the original key combination:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/combinazione_mani.jpg "Like on a piano, side view")


![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/combinazione_mani2.jpg "Like on a piano, top view")


Doesn't that look like a _piano combination_?
